yo devs! 👋 been building this platform called SkillHub to help people figure out what tech skills are actually trending, but I need some real insights from y'all! 

if you've been job hunting lately or hiring people, would love to get your input on what skills/tools are hot right now. takes like 2 minutes to contribute and you'd be helping tons of other developers!

check it out: [Your SkillHub URL]

it's not perfect yet but trying to make it a community-driven thing where we all help each other stay relevant in this crazy tech world 😅

### Message 2 (Professional Communities)
Hey everyone! I've been working on a project called SkillHub that tracks trending skills and tools in tech, but I realized it's only as good as the community input it gets.

I'm looking for experienced developers who can share insights about:
- What skills are actually in demand in your area/field
- Tools that companies are adopting
- Technologies you're seeing in job postings

Your contributions help other developers make informed decisions about what to learn next. The whole thing is designed to be community-driven because let's face it - we know better than any algorithm what's actually useful out there!

Would appreciate any input: [Your SkillHub URL]

Thanks! 🙏

### Message 3 (Beginner-Friendly Communities)
hey coding fam! 👨‍💻 I know a lot of you are trying to figure out what to learn next (been there!), so I built SkillHub to track what skills are actually trending

but here's the thing - I need input from people who are already in the industry to make it useful for everyone. if you're working as a dev or have been job hunting recently, would you mind sharing what you're seeing?

it literally takes 2 minutes and could help so many people here figure out their learning path!

no pressure though! just thought this community would appreciate having better data about what's actually worth learning 📚

**Title: "Built a platform to track trending tech skills, need your expertise!"**

Hey r/webdev! 👋

**TL;DR: Built SkillHub to help developers discover trending skills, but need real industry input to make it actually useful. 2-minute contribution could help thousands of devs.**

So I've been frustrated with how hard it is to know what skills are actually worth learning vs what's just hype. Job postings are all over the place, LinkedIn influencers push whatever they're selling, and it's hard to get real data.

That's why I built SkillHub - a community-driven platform where we can track what skills and tools are genuinely trending based on real developer experiences.

**Why I need your help:**
- Algorithms can't tell if a skill is actually useful or just buzzworthy
- You know what's really being used in production
- Your hiring/job search experience is invaluable data

**What you can contribute:**
- Skills you're seeing in job postings
- Tools your company recently adopted
- Technologies that are actually making developers more productive

I'm not trying to make money off this or anything - just want to create something that would've helped me when I was starting out and constantly wondering "what should I learn next?"

The whole platform is designed to be transparent about where data comes from, so it's not just another "learn these 10 skills" listicle.

Check it out: [Your SkillHub URL]

Would really appreciate any insights from this community. Even if you just add one skill/tool, it helps!

**Edit:** Thanks for the feedback so far! Keep it coming - every contribution makes the platform more useful for everyone.

### r/programming 

**Title: "Community-driven tech skills tracking - need your industry insights"**

I've been working on solving a problem that's bugged me for years: how do you actually know what skills are worth learning?

Most "trending skills" lists are either based on:
- Job posting keywords (which can be misleading)
- Survey data (often skewed)
- Someone's opinion (usually selling a course)

So I built SkillHub as a community-driven alternative. The idea is simple: developers who are actually working in the industry contribute insights about what they're seeing.

**What makes this different:**
- Transparent about data sources
- Community moderated
- Focused on real-world demand, not hype

**Why I need r/programming's input:**
You folks are working with cutting-edge stuff and have insights that can't be captured by scraping job boards. Whether you're seeing new tools being adopted at your company or noticing skills that are becoming obsolete, that's valuable data.

The contribution process is dead simple - just share what you're observing in your corner of the tech world.

Not trying to commercialize this or anything - just want to create a resource that would've been helpful when I was trying to figure out my career path.

What do you think? Would love feedback on the concept too.

### r/cscareerquestions

**Title: "Trying to solve 'what should I learn next?' - need industry perspectives"**

Hey everyone!

We've all been there - staring at job postings wondering "do I really need to learn 47 different frameworks?" or "is this skill actually in demand or just hype?"

I got tired of this problem and built SkillHub to crowdsource real insights from people actually working in tech.

**The problem I'm trying to solve:**
- Generic "top 10 skills" lists that don't reflect reality
- No way to know if a skill is trending up or about to be obsolete
- Advice that's too generic or region-specific

**How SkillHub is different:**
- Community-driven data from real developers
- Transparent about sources
- Focuses on practical demand, not just popularity

**Why I need YOUR input:**
- You're actively job hunting or hiring
- You know what skills companies actually value vs what they list
- Your experience helps others avoid learning dead-end technologies

Contributing takes 2 minutes and directly helps people in this community make better learning decisions.

I'm especially interested in insights from:
- Recent job hunters (what did companies actually test you on?)
- People doing technical interviews (what skills do you look for?)
- Anyone who's seen their company adopt new technologies

This isn't a commercial thing - just trying to build something that would've helped me avoid learning Flash in 2015 😅

**Update:** Already getting great contributions! Keep them coming - every data point makes this more useful for everyone here.
